                                    The Pump Action has been the flagship product in a company that I co-founded - DE Innovations Inc. which specializes in full circle e-commerce and product design. We launched a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thepumpaction/the-pump-actiontm-a-revolutionary-way-to-shotgun" style="color:#ffc033;"target="_blank"><u>Kickstarter</u></a> which allowed us to cover initial injection mould start-up costs. To this date we have generated over six figures in revenue and shipped out over 3000 products to consumers in North America, Australia and Europe.

                                    Throughout my university career, my friends and I would often supplement the mechanical engineering study grind with a few Friday beers while throwing around different business ideas. In the spring of 2020, we came up with the idea of a shotgunning device coined the “Pump Action Shotgun Tool” - a creative take on a staple party trick. Fast forward 9 months and we have sold over 3000 products across three continents, generated six figures in revenue and officially incorporated as a product design consulting company - DE Innovations Inc where we have taken on several other projects for social media influencers.

                                <p class="summary">
                                    The initial proof of concept prototype was developed using a PVC pipe, a spring, and a few nuts and bolts. This quick prototype utilized a sharp edge that could be pressed perpendicularly into the side of an aluminum can to puncture and then pumped collinearly to the height of the can in order to expand the hole.
                                </p>
                                <p style = "text-align:center;"><img src="assets/images/yohan/pumpaction2.jpg" style="width:60%"; class="center" ></p>
                                <p style = "text-align:center;"><i>Direct puncture followed with colinear pumping motion</i></p>
                                <p class="summary">
                                    Upon posting progress videos and generating a ton of interest on TikTok and Instagram, it affirmed the novelty in our idea and we started to mock up different puncture mechanisms for scalable manufacturing.
                                </p>
                                <p style = "text-align:center;"><img src="assets/images/yohan/pumpaction3.png" style="width:60%"; class="center" ></p>
                                <p style = "text-align:center;"><i>PVC Proof of Concept Model</i></p>
                                <br><h3 class="heading"> 2. The Design </h3>
                                <p class="summary">
                                    The puncture mechanism had the requirements of penetrating an aluminum can with a clean, satisfying punch that would leave a minimum of a 15mm x 20mm opening for drinking. To maintain the “pump action” (up and down) motion, we brainstormed several methods using a collinear user motion along the length of a can. After testing and iterating upon a few designs, we settled on a rack and pinion mechanism that utilizes a sharp puncturing edge on the gear.
                                </p>
                                <p style = "text-align:center;"><img src="assets/images/yohan/pumpaction4.PNG" style="width:60%"; class="center" ></p>

                                <p class="summary">
                                    The power transfer from the rack to the pinion demonstrated a consistent output of force and as a result a repeatable hole size and shape. 
                                </p>
                                <p style = "text-align:center;"><img src="assets/images/yohan/pumpaction5.png" style="width:60%"; class="center" ></p>
                                <p style = "text-align:center;"><i>Consistent puncture holes align with drinking spout</i></p>
                                <br><h3 class="heading"> 3. Initial Release + Design Iterations</h3>
                                <p class="summary">
                                    In late June, we launched an online store and listed the 3D printed Pump Action shotgun tools for beta release. In the first week, over 100 orders were placed and we were overwhelmed as we didn’t have the capabilities to print that many tools. We quickly added the “sold out” signage and began conversations with injection moulding manufacturers to develop this product at scale. The image below shows the evolution of the Pump Action from left to right. As shown in the latest two models, we listened to early adopter feedback and decided to design a drinking spout on the front of the product to give the customer an option to spin the can around to shotgun their drink.

                                <p class="summary">
                                    I interviewed up to ten American and Asian injection moulding suppliers to discuss mould manufacturing quotes, assembly/quality procedures and scalability which helped identify our most strategic partners. I worked with our selected manufacturing facility to design for injection moulding and developed the Pump Action out of high density polyethylene.
